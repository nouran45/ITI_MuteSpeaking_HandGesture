# Smart Glove Refactoring & Implementation Plan - Status Update

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive plan for transforming the single-MPU6050 codebase into a multi-sensor smart glove system with sign language gesture recognition capabilities.

## üéØ Implementation Status Update

### ‚úÖ PHASE 1: CORE FOUNDATION - COMPLETED (100%)
- ‚úÖ I2C Multiplexer Implementation - TCA9548A driver fully implemented with comprehensive API
- ‚úÖ Project Structure - Professional layered architecture (MCAL/HAL/APP/LIB)
- ‚úÖ Build System - Complete Makefile system with test infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Documentation - Comprehensive driver documentation and wiring guides

### ‚úÖ PHASE 2: MULTI-SENSOR SYSTEM - COMPLETED (100%)
- ‚úÖ MPU6050 Multi-Sensor Infrastructure - Full callback system and sensor management implemented
- ‚úÖ MPU6050 Interface Updates - All function declarations updated with sensor ID parameters
- ‚úÖ TCA9548A Integration - Complete multiplexer integration with 5-sensor support
- ‚úÖ Build System Fixes - All compilation errors resolved, project builds successfully

### ‚è≥ PHASE 3: INTELLIGENCE LAYER - IN PROGRESS (15%)
- ‚è≥ Feature Extraction Module - Foundation laid, needs implementation
- ‚è≥ Gesture Recognition System - Architecture defined, awaiting implementation
- ‚è≥ ESP32 Integration - Basic UART ready, protocol needs definition
- ‚úÖ User Interface Enhancements - Basic LCD functionality exists and tested

### ‚è≥ PHASE 4: OPTIMIZATION & DASHBOARD - PENDING (0%)
- ‚è≥ Performance Optimization - Timing analysis not yet performed
- ‚è≥ Web Dashboard - No implementation started
- ‚è≥ System Testing - Basic component tests exist, integration tests needed
