# Smart Glove System - Bug Fixes and Improvements

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Multiplexer Channel Selection in TCA9548A_ReadRegister and TCA9548A_WriteRegister
- Added explicit channel selection before I2C operations
- This ensures communication with the correct sensor on the multiplexer
- Fixed in TCA9548A_Program.c

### 2. UART Byte Reading Function Race Condition
- Implemented a proper circular buffer for UART data
- Added buffer management functions that handle data safely
- Fixed in main_gesture_stream.c

### 3. Floating-Point Performance Optimization
- Created a fixed-point math library (fixed_point.h, fixed_point.c)
- Converted the complementary filter to use fixed-point operations
- This improves performance on the AVR platform which has limited FPU support
- Applied in gesture_stream_platform.c

## Build System Issues
- Fixed issues with the Makefile and build directory structure
- Addressed UART_BUFFER_SIZE redefinition warnings

## Recommendations for Further Improvement
1. Add additional error handling for multiplexer and sensor failures
2. Consider further optimizations using lookup tables for trigonometric functions
3. Implement more robust sensor failure detection and graceful degradation
4. Review the UART handling code to ensure it works well with interrupt-based reception

## Memory Usage
- Program: 7742 bytes (23.6% Full)
- Data: 378 bytes (18.5% Full)
